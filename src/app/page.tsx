      Hi, I am Zidan, A fresh graduate student from vocational high school from SMKS Telkom Sandhy Putra Malang. I Have some knowledges and experiences building web app from my school. 

      At first, When I was just starting my education in high school (maybe june 2020?), I didnâ€™t know anything about programing beside how to write website with html. starting from that time, I gradually learn how to code with general instruction structure like looping, function, variable etc. Although the language i wrote my code is different, the general logic still the same.  

      Now I already knew and have experience with web development, whether itâ€™s in frontend or backend. Currently I want to learn java in game development while expanding my knowledge in web development.
